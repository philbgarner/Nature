# NatureEditor

This editor uses the prefabs built in my prefabEditor package and allows the user to insert them into the game scene.

## Current Version Notes

In the latest update I added a water shader which will reflect all the placed prefabs in the scene (anything rendered above the water line which is configurable will be reflected + distorted).

This distortion filter will also be used to implement the rising hot air columns which give the player's glider extra lift.

Video of the current state is here:
